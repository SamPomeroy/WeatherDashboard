My custom feature is a dynamic Weather Alerts system. When a city is entered, the dashboard checks current conditions and displays relevant alerts with contextual messages (e.g., heat warnings, clear skies). The alert messages change based on the live weather data and are printed clearly in the GUI. No major bugs are known, but future enhancements could include icon updates and regional alert parsing. I also need to work on my icons rendering.
