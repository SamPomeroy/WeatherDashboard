## ‚úçÔ∏è Section 1: Week 11 Reflection

**Key Takeaways**
- Capstone is structured with core expectations plus creative freedom via features.
- Week-by-week pacing helps avoid overwhelm.
- Architecture planning is as important as implementation.
- MVC/layered approaches are emphasized for maintainability.
- Peer collaboration and modularity are encouraged.

**Concept Connections**
- Strongest: API integration, data processing, modular architecture (MVC), debugging.
- Needs more practice: Tkinter GUI styling, testing strategies, packaging for release.

**Early Challenges**
- None major ‚Äî already have OpenWeatherMap API key and folder setup experience.
- Needed to align project expectations with structured class pace.

**Support Strategies**
- I‚Äôll use office hours for any GUI structure issues or feature integrations.
- Slack for quick syntax or config help.
- Classmates can help sanity-check architecture ideas or test features.

## üóÇÔ∏è Section 3: High-Level Architecture Sketch

**Modules**
- `core/` ‚Äî API handler, file storage, config
- `features/` ‚Äî Journal, Alerts, Favorites
- `gui/` ‚Äî Tkinter UI components
- `main.py` ‚Äî App entrypoint & coordinator

**Data Flow**
- GUI sends user input ‚Üí controller
- Controller fetches weather via API module
- Processed data flows to GUI + features
- Features log/save data to local files
