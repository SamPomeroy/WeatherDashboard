My capstone project currently has all three required features implemented. The alerts feature shows warnings for certain weather conditions, the history feature logs past queries in a text file and displays recent entries, and the journal feature allows users to write weather-related notes saved locally. As a personal enhancement, I'm working on improving the GUI styling and modularizing the logic for better maintainability. No major blockers at the moment â€” just continuing to refine and polish the interface and usability.
